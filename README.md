A portable version of DirectX Runtime and an updated version of july19jake's

Live long and prosper!

# What is this?
This is a *portable* version of DirectX. 
It's a `*.zip` file you can download and *unpack* into the root directory of a game.
It works!


# How did I create this?
1. Start Windows Sandbox instance
2. Download `DirectX End-User Runtime` installer from Microsoft website
3. Install it
4. Goto C:\Windows\System32 and copy all `d3d*.dll`, `x_input*.dll`, `XAPOFX1_*.dll` & `X3DAudio1_*.dll` into a directory.
(Ex; D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\ASTRONEER <-- Unzip and place all the .dll files IN HERE! This is the ROOT of the game!) -The Root Directoy should have the Application or .EXE
6. Profit.

# Is this safe?
I believe so. I downloaded it directly from the website.
If you wanna play safe, create your own copy of this zip.
*Do not ever run games which require Admin privileges.*
